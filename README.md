Project Overview: REST API Client Application
Objective

The objective of  REST API Client is to develop a Java application that connects to a public REST API, retrieves data using an HTTP request, processes the JSON response, and displays the information in a readable format. This task demonstrates understanding of API communication, networking concepts, and basic data parsing in Java.

CodTech Java Internship – Task 2 Overview
REST API Client Application Using Java
Introduction

Task 2 of the CodTech Java Internship focuses on building a REST API Client Application using Java. The primary goal of this task is to help interns understand how Java applications can interact with external web services over the internet using HTTP protocols. In modern software development, most applications rely on APIs to fetch real-time data such as weather information, user details, financial data, news updates, and much more. This task is designed to introduce these real-world concepts in a practical and hands-on manner.

In this task, a Java program is developed to connect to a public REST API, send an HTTP request, receive a JSON response, process that response, and display the data in a readable format. This helps interns gain practical exposure to networking concepts, API communication, and data handling in Java.

Objective of Task 2

The main objectives of Task 2 are:

To understand the concept of RESTful APIs

To learn how Java communicates with web servers using HTTP

To fetch data from an external API using a GET request

To handle and parse JSON responses

To display the extracted data in a structured format

To improve understanding of real-world Java applications

This task bridges the gap between basic Java programming and real-world application development.

Technology and Tools Used

Programming Language: Java

Java Version: Java 11 or above

Networking API: HttpClient, HttpRequest, and HttpResponse

Data Format: JSON

Development Environment: VS Code / Command Prompt

The HttpClient API introduced in Java 11 is used because it is modern, efficient, and avoids deprecated networking methods. This makes the solution future-proof and industry-relevant.

Description of the REST API

For this task, a public REST API is used that does not require authentication or API keys. The API returns data in JSON format when accessed through a specific URL. A GET request is sent to the API endpoint, and the server responds with structured JSON data.

The JSON response contains multiple key-value pairs. The Java program reads this response as a string and extracts the required fields using basic string operations. This approach avoids external libraries and keeps the project simple and beginner-friendly


Key Features

Connects to a public REST API

Sends HTTP GET request

Receives JSON response

Parses JSON data manually

Displays structured output in console

Uses standard Java libraries

Technologies Used

Java (JDK 11 or above)

java.net.http.HttpClient

java.net.URI

Outcome

By completing Task 2, the intern gains hands-on experience in:

Working with REST APIs

Understanding client-server communication

Handling HTTP requests and responses

Processing JSON data in Java

This task strengthens real-world Java skills required for backend development and API integration.
